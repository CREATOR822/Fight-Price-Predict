# Flight-Price-Predict

PROJECT DISCRIPTION:

Statement of Issue 
It can be hard to guess airline ticket rates, WE might see a fare today, find out the price of the same flight tomorrow,
it's going to be a different story. I may have heard travelers sometimes complain that the costs of airline fares are too volatile.
As data scientists, I can show that something can be expected provided the correct data.
IN THIS PROJECT I TRY TO SOLVE THIS FLIGHT PRICE PRIDICTION PROBLEM
